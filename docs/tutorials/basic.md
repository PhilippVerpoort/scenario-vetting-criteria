# Basic usage of vetting criteria
You can use the commonly defined vetting criteria by using either of:

* The raw input data files,
* the R package for loading the definitions in R,
* the Python package for loading the definitions in Python.


## Raw input data
The input data files are located in the `inst/extdata/` subdirectory of the git repository, which is [managed via GitHub](https://github.com/PhilippVerpoort/scenario-vetting-criteria/).

You can clone the full repository by running:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/PhilippVerpoort/scenario-vetting-criteria.git
```

Alternatively, you can download individual files from `inst/extdata/` directory in the latest version of `main` branch [here](https://github.com/PhilippVerpoort/scenario-vetting-criteria/tree/main/inst/extdata).
