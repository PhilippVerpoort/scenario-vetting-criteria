historical:
    name: Historical vetting
    description: >-
        Historical vetting criteria check for the alignment of scenarios with historic
        trends. Specifically, this means that the data provided by scenarios for time
        periods in the past (e.g. year 2020) should closely match data reported in the 
        real world. Misalignment of a scenario means that the scenario is or has 
        become impossible. Misalignment can often be an outcome of outdatedness: as the 
        world evolves, pathways that were set out by older scenarios are no longer 
        possible.
near_term_feasibility:
    name: Near-term feasibility vetting
    description: >-
        Near-term feasibility vetting criteria check for the alignment of scenarios with 
        near-term trends in certain sectors. Specifically, this means that the data 
        provided by scenarios for time periods in the near future (i.e., in the next 5â€“10 
        years) should not substantially deviate from what can be expected based on project 
        announcements (e.g. for hydropower, nuclear power, or carbon capture and storage). 
        While going above or below those trajectories is not strictly impossible, those 
        developments are deemed infeasible.
long_term_feasibility:
    name: Long-term feasibility vetting
    description: >-
        Long-term feasibility vetting criteria check for the alignment of scenarios with
        expected long-term growth rates of technologies. Specifically, this means that 
        the data provided by scenarios for time periods in the long-term future (i.e., 
        beyond 2040) should not grow much faster than what can be expected for this 
        specific type of technology. The growth rates of those technologies (e.g. carbon 
        capture and storage) are inferred from growth rates of comparable technologies 
        in the past (e.g., solar and wind in the 2000s) or from the most ambitious growth 
        scenarios of industry associations. Misalignment of a scenario does not mean that 
        the scenario is outright infeasible, but that a strong technology push would be 
        required to see unconventional growth rates beyond was can be otherwise be 
        expected.
sustainability:
    name: Sustainability vetting
    description: >-
        Sustainability vetting criteria check for the alignment of scenarios with 
        sustainability targets other than climate-change mitigation. Specifically, 
        this means that data provided by scenarios for certain technologies, activities, 
        or practices should not go beyond what would be sustainable in those other 
        non-climate ecosystem dimensions. The thresholds for sustainability criteria 
        are derived from literature focussing on the respective sustainability targets. 
        Misalignment of a scenario does not mean that the scenario is infeasible, but 
        rather that it is indesirable from non-climate sustainability perspectives.
