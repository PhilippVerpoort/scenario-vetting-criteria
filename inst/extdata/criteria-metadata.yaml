        The thresholds are derived from these sources for years 2010, 2015, 
        2020, and 2025 as follows:

        • Single region: ±35% deviation will lead to exclusion, ±25% will lead
        to a red flag.

        • Whole world: ±25% deviation will lead to exclusion, ±15% will lead
        to a red flag.


        Note that these ranges not only give models some leeway to deviate, but 
        also account for uncertainty in the underlying data sources. To further 
        account for uncertainty in the historical values, the most permissible 
        source of all sources for each variable, region, and period is used to 
        set the threshold.

    justification_criterion: >-
        This scenario reports a near-term decline of biodiversity intactness that 
        is stronger than what has been reported historically.


        This is a concern because this near-term trend is inconsistent with 
        historically change rates.


        The Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) targets halting human-induced species 
        extinction by 2030, which we interpret as halting reducing biodiversity intactness 
        by 2030.
    justification_threshold: >-
        Historical values for the change rate of biodiversity intactness are reported 
        by {{citep:Pereira-2024}}.

nearterm_deforestation:
    name: Near-term annual gross loss of primary and secondary forest area
    type: near_term_feasibility
    justification_criterion: >-
        This scenario reports a level of near-term deforestation that is above what has been 
        reported historically.


        This is a concern because it would mean unprecedented deforestation, which would go 
        beyond what has been experienced historically.
    justification_threshold: >-
        The highest annual rate of deforestation in the last four decades (1990–2020) was

        This scenario reports levels of food availability that are above or below human nutritional 
        needs.
        
        
        This is a concern, because food availability below nutritional needs would mean hunger and 
        because food availability above nutritional needs would mean overconsumption.
    justification_threshold: >-
        According to the {{cite:FAO}}, the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement is 2,100 kcal per person 
        per day, which is used as the lower threshold. Meanwhile, the highest historical level of 
        food availability is 4,000 kcal per person per day, so that the threshold is set at 5,000 
        kcal per person per day.

        This scenario reports a near-term forest expansion rate that is above what has been reported
        historically.
  
        
        This is a concern because it would mean unprecedented forest expansion, which would go 
        beyond what has been experienced historically.
    justification_threshold: >-
        The highest annual rate of forest expansion in the last four decades (1990–2020) was

    justification_threshold: >-
        The highest annual net change in planted forest area in the last four decades

    type: historical
    justification_criterion: >-
        This scenario reports land cover that is inconsistent with near-term trends.
        
        
        This is a concern because the underlying modelling likely makes false assumptions on land 
        cover and the efforts needed to reduce emissions while growing sufficient food.
    justification_threshold: >-
        Near-term values for land cover are provided by {{LUH3}}.
        
        The threshold for 2030 is derived from this source as follows:

        • ±10% deviation will lead to exclusion.

        Note that this range not only give models some leeway to deviate, but 
        also account for uncertainty in the underlying data sources.
nearterm_hydro:
    name: Near-term expansion of hydropower
    type: near_term_feasibility
    justification_criterion: >-
        This scenario assumes a deployment of hydropower plants that is
        inconsistent with near-term projections.


        Near-term upper and lower capacity projections can be derived from
        existing capacities and from current project announcements and known
        project lead times. Robust upper projections can be made because
        projects take at least 5 years to plan and construct and therefore
        will not be operational by 2030 if not yet announced by today. Robust
        lower projections can be made based on exisiting capacities and
        because retirement rates can reasonably be assumed to be low.


        Specifically, hydropower plants take 4–7 years to construct (for
        medium-sized projects) and up to 15 years (for large-sized projects)
        to plan and construct. Small projects that can be completed within
        less than 4 years make up less than 3% of all projects planned
        globally in 2021.

        • Accelerated: capacity that could come online by 2030 given an
        acceleration in efforts.
        

        We assume the following thresholds for 2030 based on data provided by 
        the IEA:

        • Lower, red:  10% (globally) less than currently operational capacities.

        • Lower, yellow: 5% (globally) or 40% (regionally) less than what is
        expected to come online according to the IEA by 2030.

        expected to come online assuming accelerated efforts according to the 
        IEA by 2030.

        operational today plus bringing retired plants in Japan back online 
        plus 75% of plants under construction.

        CCU/S projects are tracked by the IEA and published annually in its 
        CCUS Database. Details can be found here:
        https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/ccus-projects-database
        

        Projects in the CCUS database have one of the following statuses:

        • Operational: in operation in 2024

        • Construction: currently under construction

        • Planned: announced but without final investment decision in 2024.
        Projects that were decommissioned or suspended are not 
        

        We assume the following thresholds for 2030 based on data provided by 
        the IEA CCUS database:

        • Lower, red:  10% (globally) less than currently operational
        capacities.

        • Lower, yellow:  5% (globally) or 40% (regionally) less than
        currently operational capacities and 50% of projects under construction.

        • Upper, yellow:  5% (globally) or 40% (regionally) more than plants
        operational today plus all projects under construction plus 20% of 
        projects planned without FID.

        • Upper, red:  10% (globally) more than all projects operational,
        under construction, and announced.
nearterm_solar:

    type: near_term_feasibility
    justification_criterion: >-
        This scenario assumes a deployment of solar photovoltaics that is
        inconsistent with near-term market outlooks.


        This technology is available at scale and has short project lead
        times, meaning that there are no fundamental obstacles to fast
        deployment. Yet, it's near-term growth can be estimated based on
        today's market dynamics. While these estimates have their limitations,
        they can be used to set broad ranges of near-term feasibility.
    justification_threshold: >-
        Existing capacities in 2023 are reported by {{cite:Ember-2024}}. Yearly 
        additions for 2024–2030 are estimated in a market outlook by 
        {{cite:BNEF-2024}}.


        We assume the following thresholds for 2025 and 2030:

        • Lower, red: 10% (globally) less than existing capacities plus
        37.5% of market outlook.

        • Lower, yellow: 5% (globally) or 40% (regionally) less than

nearterm_wind_onshore:
    name: Future near-term expansion of on-shore wind capacity
    type: near_term_feasibility
    justification_criterion: >-
        This scenario assumes a deployment of on-shore wind that is
        inconsistent with near-term market outlooks.


        This technology is available at scale and has short project lead
        times, meaning that there are no fundamental obstacles to fast
        deployment. Yet, it's near-term growth can be estimated based on

        This outlook is based on input from regional wind associations, 
        government targets, tender results, announced auction plans, available 
        project pipeline, and input from industry experts.


        We assume the following thresholds for 2025 and 2030:

        • Lower, red: 10% (globally) less than existing capacities plus
        37.5% of market outlook.

longterm_cropland_yield:
    name: Future long-term crop-land yield
    type: long_term_feasibility
    justification_criterion: >-
        This scenario assumes future long-term crop-land yields that go 
        beyond what is technically feasible.
    justification_threshold: >-

longterm_nuclear:
    name: Future long-term expansion of nuclear power
    type: long_term_feasibility
    justification_criterion: >-
        This scenario assumes a high long-term deployment of nuclear power
        plants.


        Nuclear power is a technology that is known to exhibit low growth
        rates. While governmental programmes to speed up development could
        results in a increased growth rates, such developments seem unlikely
        given recent trends and the required public funding. This is
        reflected by the fact that even the industry's own association (the
        International Atomic Energy Agency) estimates a maximum increase
        of today's capacity by 150% {{citep:IAEA-2024}}.
    justification_threshold: >-
        The International Atomic Energy Agency publishes its own long-term 
        estimates for nuclear power-plant capacity {{citep:IAEA-2024}}. The
        highest estimates are at 694 GWe in 2040 and 950 GWe in 2050.
longterm_ccus:
    name: Future long-term expansion of carbon capture
    type: long_term_feasibility
    justification_criterion: >-
        This scenario assumes a high deployment of CCU/S beyond 2035. CCU/S
        involves capturing CO₂ from flue gases and storing it geologically or
        in products. The required technologies for these activities are highly
        non-modular and application-specific. Additionally, CCS depends on
        infrastructure like CO₂ pipeline networks, which still have to be
        built. Therefore it will likely grow more slowly than modular
        technologies with some degree of existing infrastructure, such as
        solar, wind, and batteries.
    justification_threshold: >-
        This scenario assumes capacity deployment of CCS in 2035 and 2040 that 
        would require unlikely growth rates (compare {{cite:Kazlou-2024}}).
longterm_daccs:
    name: Future long-term expansion of DACCS
    type: long_term_feasibility
    justification_criterion: >-
        This scenario assumes a high deployment of Direct Air Capture with
        Carbon Storage (DACCS).


        DACCS is a technology that is very immature today. Moreover, CO₂ is
        captured  directly from the atmosphere, which has a much lower CO₂
        concentration than flue gases from points sources (e.g. a cement
        or waste-incineration plant), the purification of CO₂ is much
        harder and cannot be achieved with established carbon capture
        technologies.


        In summary, this causes DACCS to be a technology that will likely take
        a long time to develop and scale up.
    justification_threshold: >-
        An upper limit of 4.89 Gt CO2eq/yr of DACCS is derived by 
        {{cite:Edwards-2024}}.
sustainable_biodiversity_intactness:
    name: Sustainability concerns due to declining biodiversity intactness
    type: sustainability
    justification_criterion: >-
        Halting biodiversity loss is considered a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) by 
        the United Nations for maritime (SDG14) and terrestrial (SDG15) life 
        {{citep:UN-SDGs-2025}}. According to the 2024 Planetary Boundary Health Check 
        {{citep:PBHC-2024}}, the loss of genetic diversity exceeded its safe levels in 
        2024. The {{cite:GBF-2025}} targets halting human-induced species extinction by 2030.
    justification_threshold: >-
        We interpret the target of halting human-induced species extinction by 2030 as a 
        non-negative change rate of the biodiversity intactness index.


        Therefore, the lower threshold for the biodiversity intactness index is set to zero.
sustainable_deforestation:
    name: Sustainability concerns due to annual gross loss of primary and secondary forest area
    type: sustainability
    justification_criterion: >-
        Managing forests sustainably is considered a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) by 
        the United Nations (SDG15) {{citep:UN-SDGs-2025}}. The Target 1 put forward by the 
        {{cite:GBF-2025}} implies close to zero deforestation by 2030.
    justification_threshold: >-
        We interpret the target of near-zero deforestation as 0 Mha/year of deforestation in 
        2030.


        Therefore, the lower threshold for deforestation is set to zero.
sustainable_primary_deforestation:
    name: Sustainability concerns due to annual gross loss of primary forest area
    type: sustainability
    justification_criterion: >-
        Managing forests sustainably is considered a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) by 
        the United Nations (SDG15) {{citep:UN-SDGs-2025}}. The Target 1 put forward by the 
        {{cite:GBF-2025}} implies close to zero deforestation by 2030.
    justification_threshold: >-
        We interpret the target of near-zero deforestation as 0 Mha/year of deforestation in 
        2030.


        Therefore, the lower threshold for deforestation is set to zero.
sustainable_bioenergy:
    name: Sustainability concerns due to excessive biomass use
    type: sustainability
    justification_criterion: >-
        This scenario assumes a high usage of bioenergy. Specifically, we
        here refer to 2nd generation bioenergy crops, crop and forestry
        residues, municipal solid waste bioenergy and traditional biomass.


        Bioenergy can be a drop-in replacement to currently used fossil fuels.
        When grown in a sustainable fashion, their life-cycle of production
        and use is GHG neutral. Bio-based energy crops can be grown at low
        cost and with readily available technologies.


        Some decarbonisation scenarios therefore tend to assume a high use of
        bioenergy. Meanwhile, such a high use of bioenergy can result in (a)
        growth practices that are no longer GHG neutral in their life cycle
        (e.g. through deforestation to create more arable land for energy
        crops) or result in (b) a loss of natural habitats, which creates
        other sustainability concerns, for instance linked to a loss of
        biodiversity.
    justification_threshold: >-
        {{cite:Creutzig-2014}} have derived an upper limit for sustainable 
        biomass use of 100–300 EJ/yr. In the 6th Assessment Report of Working 
        Group 3 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a value of
        100 EJ/yr is defined as the threshold for the onset of medium concern and 
        245 EJ/yr a threshold for the onset of high concern 
        {{citep:IPCC-AR6-WG3-ANX3-2022}}. Another study by {{cite:Deprez-2024}} 
        suggests that medium sustainablity risks arise at 50 EJ/yr and high 
        risks at 120 EJ/yr. Based on those studies the threshold for this 
        sustainablity concern flag is set at 100 EJ/yr.
sustainable_hydropower:
    name: Sustainability concerns due to excessive hydropower deployment
    type: sustainability
    justification_criterion: >-
        Hydropower can negatively impact nature by altering river ecosystems,
        disrupting fish migration, and affecting water quality. Dams can
        change natural water flow, leading to habitat loss for aquatic and
        terrestrial species. They can also trap sediment, which is essential
        for maintaining downstream ecosystems. {{cite:Thieme-2021}} found that
        if all planned hydropower dams would complete construction, this
        would result in the loss of 260,000 kilometers of free-flowing rivers
        globally.
    justification_threshold: >-
        {{cite:Opperman-2019}} show that a low level of hydropower expansion of 
        no more than 1500 GW hydropower globally combined with strategic 
        planning of the siting of new hydropower could reduce impacts on 
        free-flowing rivers by 90%.
