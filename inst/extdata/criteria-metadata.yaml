        This scenario assumes a deployment of hydropower plants that is

        Near-term upper and lower capacity projections can be derived from
        existing capacities and from current project announcements and known
        project lead times. Robust upper projections can be made because
        projects take at least 5 years to plan and construct and therefore
        will not be operational by 2030 if not yet announced by today. Robust
        lower projections can be made based on exisiting capacities and
        because retirement rates can reasonably be assumed to be low.


        Specifically, hydropower plants take 4–7 years to construct (for
        medium-sized projects) and up to 15 years (for large-sized projects)
        to plan and construct. Small projects that can be completed within
        less than 4 years make up less than 3% of all projects planned
        globally in 2021.

        Nuclear power is a technology that is known to exhibit low growth

        results in a increased growth rates, such developments seem unlikely
        given recent trends and the required public funding. This is

longterm_ccus:
    name: Future long-term expansion of carbon capture
    type: long_term_feasibility
    justification_criterion: >-
        This scenario assumes a high deployment of CCU/S beyond 2035. CCU/S
        involves capturing CO₂ from flue gases and storing it geologically or
        in products. The required technologies for these activities are highly
        non-modular and application-specific. Additionally, CCS depends on
        infrastructure like CO₂ pipeline networks, which still have to be
        built. Therefore it will likely grow more slowly than modular
        technologies with some degree of existing infrastructure, such as
        solar, wind, and batteries.
    justification_threshold: >-

        This scenario assumes a high deployment of Direct Air Capture with
        Carbon Storage (DACCS).


        DACCS is a technology that is very immature today. Moreover, CO₂ is
        captured  directly from the atmosphere, which has a much lower CO₂
        concentration than flue gases from points sources (e.g. a cement
        or waste-incineration plant), the purification of CO₂ is much
        harder and cannot be achieved with established carbon capture
        technologies.


        In summary, this causes DACCS to be a technology that will likely take
        a long time to develop and scale up.

        This scenario is not comparaboe with the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) target 
        aiming to halt species extinctions by 2030.
sustainable_bioenergy:
    name: Sustainability concerns due to excessive biomass use
    type: sustainability
    justification_criterion: >-
        This scenario assumes a high usage of bioenergy. Specifically, we
        here refer to 2nd generation bioenergy crops, crop and forestry
        residues, municipal solid waste bioenergy and traditional biomass.


        Bioenergy can be a drop-in replacement to currently used fossil fuels.
        When grown in a sustainable fashion, their life-cycle of production
        and use is GHG neutral. Bio-based energy crops can be grown at low
        cost and with readily available technologies.


        Some decarbonisation scenarios therefore tend to assume a high use of
        bioenergy. Meanwhile, such a high use of bioenergy can result in (a)
        growth practices that are no longer GHG neutral in their life cycle
        (e.g. through deforestation to create more arable land for energy
        crops) or result in (b) a loss of natural habitats, which creates
        other sustainability concerns, for instance linked to a loss of
        biodiversity.

        {{cite:Creutzig-2014}} have derived an upper limit for sustainable 
        biomass use of 100–300 EJ/yr. In the 6th Assessment Report of Working 
        Group 3 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a value of
        100 EJ/yr is defined as the threshold for the onset of medium concern and 
        245 EJ/yr a threshold for the onset of high concern 
        {{citep:IPCC-AR6-WG3-ANX3-2022}}. Another study by {{cite:Deprez-2024}} 
        suggests that medium sustainablity risks arise at 50 EJ/yr and high 
        risks at 120 EJ/yr. Based on those studies the threshold for this 
        sustainablity concern flag is set at 100 EJ/yr.
sustainable_hydropower:
    name: Sustainability concerns due to excessive hydropower deployment
    type: sustainability
    justification_criterion: >-
        Hydropower can negatively impact nature by altering river ecosystems,
        disrupting fish migration, and affecting water quality. Dams can
        change natural water flow, leading to habitat loss for aquatic and
        terrestrial species. They can also trap sediment, which is essential
        for maintaining downstream ecosystems. {{cite:Thieme-2021}} found that
        if all planned hydropower dams would complete construction, this
        would result in the loss of 260,000 kilometers of free-flowing rivers
        globally.
    justification_threshold: >-
        {{cite:Opperman-2019}} show that a low level of hydropower expansion of 
        no more than 1500 GW hydropower globally combined with strategic 
        planning of the siting of new hydropower could reduce impacts on 
        free-flowing rivers by 90%.
